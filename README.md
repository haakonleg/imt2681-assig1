# IMT2681 Assigment 1
## igcinfo

This is a project in the course IMT2681 Cloud Technologies.
The task was to build an API utilizing the open-source library [goigc](https://github.com/marni/goigc), where users can submit links to IGC files and the API will parse the library and add it to an in-memory database. The tracks can then be queried using RESTful API paths.
